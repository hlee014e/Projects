# Credit Risk Modeling (Notebook)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hlee014e/ucsd-mle-bootcamp/blob/main/Projects/Credit_risk.ipynb)

This project explores **credit risk modeling** with a reproducible Jupyter/Colab notebook.  
It walks through data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, training baseline and tree-based models, and evaluating performance with industry-standard metrics.

## Whatâ€™s inside

- **Notebook:** `Projects/Credit_risk.ipynb`
- **Goals:** Predict probability of default (PD) / delinquency risk  
- **Methods:** Train/test split, cross-validation, Logistic Regression (baseline), Tree/Ensemble models (e.g., RandomForest/XGBoost/LightGBM as applicable)  
- **Metrics:** ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, KS statistic, F1/Recall/Precision, Brier score, calibration plots  
- **Artifacts:** Confusion matrix, feature importance, threshold analysis

> If you later move the notebook to a different repo or folder, update the Colab badge link above.
